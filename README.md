### Welcome / Bienvenue! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark, a Product Owner and Software Developer, and I love making things that help people or explore cool new ideas ðŸ˜„

I have 6 years' experience working at an edtech startup and held multiple responsibilities as teams grew. I'm currently looking for a new role, so please get in touch if you're reading this!

Aside from technology, I'm an enthusiastic sports player; I've represented Great Britain in 19 international floorball matches :gb:, I play cricket :cricket_game: and field hockey :field_hockey: for local clubs, and I've also dabbled in football :soccer:, tennis :tennis:, rugby :rugby_football:, ice hockey :ice_hockey: and more!

### What I'm working on
- Using Machine Learning and Comupter Vision to develop a real-time sports-stats app, making it more efficient for coaches to identify and optimise tactics.
- Developing my proficiency in React (using hooks more, and learning Redux) 
- Building a portfolio site (coming soon!)

### Prior Experience:
#### Software Developer:
- Created several in-house web apps to improve day-to-day processes for internal teams. Used: AngularJS, CherryPy.

- Built on prior research around machine learning algorithms to train an agent that plays Ms Pacman. Used: Python, OpenAI.
- Created proof-of-concept apps in different verticals: an Android app, a Unity 3d game in VR, and a Firefox extension.

#### Product Owner:
- Led teams to design and implement a student-facing insights feature, allowing students to see the progress they're making in an easy-to-understand way.
- Worked with a senior PO to bring a new independent learning product to market, reaching 20,000+ users in a few months, and rapidly iterating on features based on user feedback.
- Collaborated with Design, Marketing, Customer Relations, Content and other teams across several large-scale projects, but also on rapidly releasing smaller changes to specific deadlines.
- Run user testing sessions (across a variety of different types of users) that informed upcoming feature development.
