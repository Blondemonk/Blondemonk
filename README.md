Aside from technology, I'm an enthusiastic sports player; I've represented Great Britain in 19 international floorball matches :gb:, I play cricket :cricket_game: and field hockey :field_hockey: for local clubs, and I've also dabbled in football :soccer:, tennis :tennis:, rugby :rugby_football:, ice hockey :ice_hockey: and more!
